# Modelling-And-Control-Of-Robots

Overview

This robotics package is intended to allow the user to create a robot of any configuration, using interactive GUI, and automatically calculate the following:
●	Manipulator dynamics:
I.	Finding Equations of Motion for a Manipulator Dynamics
II.	Plotting Joint Position and Velocity
●	Manipulator Controls:
I.	Plotting Desired vs Actual end-effector position
a.	PD control with Gravity Compensation
b.	Inverse Dynamics Control

Assumptions:
The following assumptions should be made:
●	All the joints are revolute or prismatic
●	All the links are straight

Software used:
MATLAB version 2020a.
Peter Corke Robotic Toolbox version 9.10.
